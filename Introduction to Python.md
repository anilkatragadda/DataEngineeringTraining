# Introduction to Python

## Philosophy of Python

[The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters](https://github.com/anilkatragadda/DataEngineeringTraining/blob/87438f4f90c53210c63d36b266137e96afb258a9/The%20Zen%20of%20Python.md)

## Creating and Running Python Programs

 - Python files normally have an extension of .py
 - C:\py3eg\>hello.py


## Data Types

 - Integers -- int()
 - Booleans -- bool()
 1. True
 2. False

 - Floating-Point Types -- float()
 - Strings -- str()

## Basics

### Dynamically Typed
 - In Python we are not required to declare type for variables. Whenever we are assigning the value, based on value, type will be allocated automatically.Hence Python is considered as dynamically typed language.
